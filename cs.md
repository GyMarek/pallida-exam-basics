# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Method is a function associated with a class. Methods are called using instance or object and are used to manipuate instance variable of a class.
Every method is a function but not every function is a method.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The constructor is called, whenever a class or struct is created and it has a same naem as the class or struct, and initialize the data members of the new object.
An instance constructor is a member that implements the actions required to initialize an instance of a class.
A constructor is invoked when you use the "new" operator, or use the various methods of reflection to create an instance of a class.
